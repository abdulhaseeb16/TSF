    <h1>About Us</h1>
    <p>
      <b>A contribution is a gift given to a cause, humanitarian organisation, or charity. A contribution can come in many different ways, such as cash, alms, services, or tangible objects like furniture, toys, food, or automobiles. A donation might meet a demand for transplantable organs or blood.
      Gifts in kind are another name for donations of products or services made to charity.
      Making a gift in honour or remembrance of someone or something is achievable by making a donation in their honour or name. Gifts can be given in honour of or in remembrance of someone else for a number of occasions, such as the holidays, a wedding, a loved one who has passed away, a pet, or in the name of organisations or associations that are no longer in existence. Sometimes, the survivors of the deceased will ask for memorial gifts, generally asking for contributions to go to a charity for which the deceased was a contributor or volunteer, or to a cause appropriate to the deceased's priorities in life or way of death. If someone is unable to attend the event, they may still make a memorial contribution.</b>
